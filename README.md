Linear-Algebra
==============
This Collection of code, is intended to represent most common and major Linear Algebra problems and solutions.
While giving me the opportunity to continue to learn C++ with Const correct style, and once complete will provide me 
a project to practice make commands and language.

Building
==============
To build run the following commands in the directory you wish to store the project
```
git clone https://github.com/StephenNu/Linear-Algebra.git
cd Linear-Algebra
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
```

Testing
==============
To make the tests you need to run the 
```
make check
```
command, this will download and install GTest 1.7.0 and GMock 1.7.0 and run them. All test executables will be stored in ./bin

To-Do
==============
I plan on creating an demo project that will show how to link and use this library. Once this is done I will link to it from here.
