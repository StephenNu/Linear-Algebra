/**
  \mainpage Introduction to the Linear Algebra Library

  Originally this project was designed as a way for me to learn c++ focusing on c++11 features, and also const correctness.

  With this recent rework though I've decided to change the project a bit and focus on c++14, constexpr for compile time computations, and immutable objects for a functional style. I have also decided to integrate a unit testing framework GTest, as well as automated documentation generation by doxygen.
